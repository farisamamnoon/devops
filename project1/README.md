This project is about gaining hands-on experience deploying and managing applications on AWS EKS, including core Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, Services), Ingress setup with ALB Ingress Controller, and IRSA(IAM Rules for Service Accounts) for secure AWS access. The project uses DevOps tools like kubectl, eksctl, Helm, and AWS CLI, while using Fargate Profiles for serverless compute.

This is a practice for implementing cloud-native architectures for scalable, production-ready environments.
