# üöÄ Azure Microservices Deployment with Azure DevOps and Argo CD
This repository contains a multi-microservice voting application built with containerized components (vote, result, worker), each with independent Dockerfiles, demonstrating a complete Azure cloud CI/CD pipeline from GitHub to Azure Repos, using Azure Pipelines for builds, Azure Container Registry for image storage, Azure Kubernetes Service for deployment, and Argo CD for GitOps-based continuous delivery.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Azure Account:** With an active subscription.
* **Azure DevOps Organization:** With a project created.
* **`az` CLI:** Installed locally for Azure resource management.
* **`kubectl`:** Installed locally for Kubernetes cluster management.
* **Docker:** Installed on your CI agent VM.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The deployment architecture involves:

* **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** To store Docker images.
* **Azure DevOps:** For Continuous Integration (CI) to build and push Docker images.
* **Self-Hosted Azure DevOps Agent:** A dedicated VM for building images, ensuring consistent build environments.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** The runtime environment for the microservices.
* **Argo CD:** For Continuous Delivery (CD) to synchronize Kubernetes manifests with the AKS cluster.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to set up your CI/CD pipelines and deploy the application.

### 1. Azure Resource Provisioning

#### 1.1 Create Azure Resource Group

First, create a resource group to logically group all your Azure resources.

```bash
az group create --name <your-resource-group-name> --location <your-preferred-azure-region>
```

#### 1.2 Create Azure Container Registry 

```bash
az acr create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-acr-name> --sku Basic
```


### 2. Azure Devops Setup

#### 2.1 Import GitHub repository

* Import the example voting app repository into your Azure DevOps project.

* Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.

* Go to Repos > Files.

* Click "Import repository" (or "Initialize" if it's a new repo, then "Import").

* Paste the clone URL: https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app.git

#### 2.2 Create Self-Hosted Azure DevOps Agent

##### 2.2.1 Create an Agent Pool

* In Azure DevOps, go to Project settings > Agent pools.

* Click "Add pool".

* Give it a pool.name (e.g., MyCustomAgentPool).

* Select "Self-hosted".

* Click "Create".

##### 2.2.2 Create an Azure agent for the pool

* Create a Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu) in Azure. Ensure it has enough resources for Docker builds.

* Crucially, ensure the VM's CPU architecture matches the architecture you intend to deploy to AKS. For example, if your AKS node pool will be amd64, your agent VM should also be amd64.

##### 2.2.3 Configure the VM as an Agent 

* In Azure DevOps, go back to Agent pools > MyCustomAgentPool.

* Click "New agent".

* Follow the on-screen instructions to download, configure, and run the agent software on your newly created VM

* During config.sh, provide your Azure DevOps URL, PAT (Personal Access Token) for authentication, and the pool.name you created.

##### 2.2.4 Install Docker on the Agent VM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker <your_vm_user>
```

> After adding your user to the docker group, log out and log back in to the VM for the changes to take effect.

#### 2.3 Create Azure DevOps Pipelines (CI)

You'll create a separate build pipeline for each microservice. This enables independent deployments.

##### 2.3.1 Create a New Pipeline

* In Azure DevOps, go to Pipelines > Pipelines.

* Click "New pipeline".

* Select "Azure Repos Git" and choose your imported repository.

* Select "Docker" as the template (Docker build and push an image to Azure Container Registry).

* Configure the connection to your Azure subscription and ACR.

##### 2.3.2 Edit the YAML

```yaml
trigger:
  paths:
    include:
    - vote/* 
```
